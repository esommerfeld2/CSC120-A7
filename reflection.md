- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
I like that you can bring over past methods and that the children all can have a standardized way of interacting due to what they inherit. I feel like they make my program more concise and easeir to understand.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
This assignment went well, I feel like I am now familar with java so coding isn't as hard because I have a basic understanding of what I have to do and the way you do that in java. I would say rememember to take breaks. I coded the library and cafe classes in one sitting which was not smart because cafe was a disaster that would not work. Going back to it the next day I had so many questions of why I coded cafe in the hardest way possible and easily fixed it. So when you get tired, just step away it will save you time in the long run!
